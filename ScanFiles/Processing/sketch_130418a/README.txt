In order for the Sketch file to run, you must add in two jar files and add a font. Both of the jars are in the ZXing folder. 


JAR FILES:

	The first one to add is the core.jar, which is found within the core folder. The second one to add is the javase.jar, which is found within the javase folder.

FONT:

When you have the Sketch file open within the Processing Application, you must add in the SansSerif-48 font. To do this, you first go to Tools->Create Font. Within this window, you must select SansSerif. In case of Windows, if you select SansSerif.plan, you must make sure in the Filename selection box that it reads as SansSerif-48. Once you do this, you can select ok. 

Once you finish these two things, you can run the Sketch file and test the QR scanning.
